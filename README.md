# MagistarHeroes

After playing a bunch of Robin in Sm4sh, I wanted a game that felt similar to his/her gameplay. A side-scrolling, 2d platformer
with a variety of spells and abilities. Something like Gunstar Heroes, one of my all-time favourites.

The result is this, the uncreatively-named MagistarHeroes.

A work in progress.
